<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Good luck to this year's applicants! And congrats to last year&rsquo;s awardees!</strong><br/><br/>To add your essays to the list below, head on over to my contact page and send me an email. :)<br/><br/>As a successful applicant to the program in 2013, I wanted to share my two cents on the process and what might help future applicants stand out. That being said, the evaluation process can be somewhat... <a href="https://smallpondscience.com/2015/04/01/nsf-graduate-fellowships-are-a-part-of-the-problem/" target="_blank">random</a>... so if you don't get it, keep your head high! It says nothing about your scientific ability or potential to succeed in grad school. You gain so much just from the process of applying. So, hang on to that and then just move on to the next thing.<br/><br/>Below, you'll find an overview of the program, tips and advice on writing the essays, a suggested timeline, and some examples from past applicants. But if you have another question I haven't answered here, please feel free to send me an email, and I'll add it in. :)<br/><br/><em style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"><strong>Important note</strong>: <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/applicants/faqs" target="_blank">As of 2016</a>, you may now only apply to the program <u>once</u> as a undergraduate and <u>once</u> as a graduate student. If you applied in 2015 as a grad student and did not win, you are 'grandfathered' into the old rules and may apply once more.</em><br/>&#8203;</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="6"><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></font><br/><br/><span>The National Science Foundation's&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/about_the_program">Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a><span>&nbsp;is the oldest fellowship of its kind, and has&nbsp;</span>acceptance rates<span>&nbsp;on par with some of the most prestigious fellowships in the country. Since the start of the program in 1952, there have been over 500,000 applicants, and more than 46,500 proposals funded. 40 of those awardees have gone on to become Nobel laureates, and over 400 are now a part of the National Academy of Sciences.</span></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3">The fellowship offers a <strong>3-year, annual $34,000 stipend, and $12,000 cost of education</strong> allowance which goes toward tuition and fees. If accepted to the program, you are also offered opportunities for <strong>international research experience</strong>, <strong>professional development</strong>, and <strong>access to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a></strong>; not to mention... no more TA-ing, and no more restrictions on what you're allowed to research because the grant your adviser is funding you on doesn't cover that area.&nbsp;<strong>You are free to work on&nbsp;<em>your own</em>&nbsp;research.<br/><br/>&#8203;</strong></font><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">For more details on which disciplines are supported and who can apply, here is the&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="../../../20240117135342/http_/www.malloryladd.com/uploads/2/3/6/0/23606636/2014_nsf_grfp_presentation.pdf">NSF's summary of the program</a><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">.</span></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="5">What do I need to complete to apply?</font><br/><br/>2 essays<br/>3 recommendation letters<br/>Fastlane (online submission system) requirements</div>

<div class="wsite-spacer" style="height:50px;"></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><u><strong><font size="3"><font color="#2a2a2a">Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement (3 pages maximum)</font></font></strong></u><br/><br/><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3">This is how your review panel will get to know the real you. Sure, they'll have your transcripts and list of awards or whatnot (see Fastlane extras below), but that won't be as important as what they will find in this essay. In a presentation by the program director at the time,&nbsp;Dr. Gisele Muller-Parker, she said<strong> "the GRFP program funds people, not projects."</strong> They want to know that whoever they fund will be an autonomous, self-motivated researcher. They want to find someone who has significant potential to advance scientific knowledge <strong>(intellectual merit)</strong>, AND benefit society <strong>(broader impacts)</strong>. That's why they are now <strong>requiring separate sections</strong> for each of these criteria in <strong><em>both</em> </strong>essays (more on these in the Advice section below).<br/><br/><span><strong>Here is how I ended up breaking down my first essay:</strong>&nbsp;</span><br/><br/><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">1.5 pages: Previous research experience (relevant background)</span><br/><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">1.0 page: Intellectual merit and broader impacts (personal statement)<br/>0.5 page: Current research and future goals</span><br/><br/><span>But composition will vary based on how much research experience you have and what you want to highlight about yourself. I have read some successfully funded essays where the authors speak very little of their previous research (some applicants don't have much previous research experience), but they instead decided to focus on something that made them stand out from the crowd. <strong>These are the 3 pages that will help the reviewers remember you.</strong> What makes you unique? Why are you the better choice than all the rest of the applicants? Get your confidence hat out and brag away! This is also the place where you will make a case for <strong>why you will succeed at graduate research</strong>. What have you learned? How do you <strong><em>know</em></strong> this is what you want to do? And, finally, they want to find someone who has the <strong>capacity to be a leader</strong>. Talk about <strong><em>specific</em></strong> experiences where you had to take charge, face adversity, and grow, and how those experiences will help you succeed in the future.</span></font></div>

<div class="wsite-spacer" style="height:50px;"></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><u><strong><font size="3"><font color="#2a2a2a">Graduate Research Plan Statement (2 pages maximum)</font></font></strong></u><br/><br/><font color="#2a2a2a">This is the meat and potatoes for what you plan to research (yes, I'm from the Midwest). This is how the review panel will determine if you are able to comb through the literature, find a&nbsp;<strong>'knowledge gap'</strong>, and then propose a way to fill that gap. This needs to be the&nbsp;<strong>clearest</strong>&nbsp;and most&nbsp;<strong>concrete&nbsp;</strong>part of your application (no vague statements of action). It should be<strong>&nbsp;easy to read</strong>, and should&nbsp;<strong>link&nbsp;</strong>to your Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement somehow. Reviewers like to see how your previous experiences have led you, or motivated you, to pursue this particular line of research.<br/><br/><strong>Here's how I broke mine down</strong>&nbsp;the second time around: single spaced, some bold and italicized words to highlight sections or important information, and as many specific details as I could fit into each sentence as possible. 2 pages runs out quickly, so every sentence, and every word is important.&nbsp;The feedback from my first review panel in 2013 recommended I have a&nbsp;<strong>defined set of hypotheses</strong>, and that my experimental approach should&nbsp;<strong>clearly answer the scientific aims&nbsp;</strong>or research objectives (see Examples at the bottom of this page).</font><br/><br/><font color="#2a2a2a">Introduction</font><font color="#2a2a2a"><font size="3"><br/>Research Objectives<br/>Hypotheses<br/>Preliminary Results (if you have any from previous research)<br/>Study Site (if proposed research has a field work component)<br/>Experimental Approach<br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>References</font></font></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><u><strong><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3">Recommendation Letters (3)</font></strong></u><br/><br/><font><font color="#2a2a2a">You've probably heard it before, but I'll say it again, these need to be people who&nbsp;<em><strong>know</strong></em>&nbsp;you. Make sure they have<strong>&nbsp;1)</strong>&nbsp;read both of your statements,&nbsp;<strong>2)</strong>&nbsp;know where you are applying or going to graduate school,&nbsp;<strong>3)&nbsp;</strong>have a copy of your CV so they can reference awards and past activities, and&nbsp;<strong>4)&nbsp;</strong>have a clear idea of what your goals for the future are. One of the questions I get asked a lot is 'What type of information should referees include in their GRFP reference letter?' I recommend&nbsp;<strong>emailing your references</strong>&nbsp;the list below, along with a&nbsp;<a href="../../../20240117135332/http_/www.malloryladd.com/uploads/2/3/6/0/23606636/nsf_merit_review_criteria_overview.pdf" target="_blank">description of the intellectual merit and broader impacts criteria</a>. You'll want each of your references to be able to speak to both. <strong>Don't be afraid to ask each of them to include specific points you would like to highlight. </strong>They'll actually probably appreciate the direction with how busy their schedules can be.<br/><br/>A reference letter-writer should:<br/><br/>- indicate department and institution, how long they have known you, and in what capacity<br/>- comment on your potential to:<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +&nbsp;succeed in graduate school<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +&nbsp;conduct original research<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + communicate effectively<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +&nbsp;work cooperatively with peers and supervisors<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +&nbsp;make unique contributions to your chosen discipline and to society in general<br/>- comment on your leadership potential&nbsp;both in your chosen field, and as a member of the scientific community<br/>- discuss a specific positive experience or interaction they have had with you<br/>- Note: if you referee is your research supervisor, they should comment on the originality of your proposal, and communicate what role she or he played in assisting you with your proposal.</font></font></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><font size="6"><font color="#2a2a2a"><u><strong>Suggested Timeline</strong></u></font></font><br/><br/>Alright, so I know scientists wait 'til the last minute to do everything, but if you start early, you'll have <u>plenty</u> of time to have multiple people read your essays, write your recommendations letters, etc. Also, if you're finishing up your senior year of undergrad, or just getting started in grad school, you're going to have a million other things going on, so by spreading it out, it doesn't become such a burden. Here's the schedule I tried to stick to both times I applied:<br/><br/><strong>June:&nbsp;</strong>Find out as much information as you can about the program. After you're done here, check the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF GRFP website</a>, <a href="http://forum.thegradcafe.com/topic/68145-nsf-grfp-2016/" target="_blank">thegradcafe</a>&nbsp; forum, or some of the resources I have listed below.<br/><br/><strong>July:&nbsp;</strong>Start reading the literature and combing through the discussion/conclusions sections for potential 'knowledge gaps' you could propose to 'fill in' with your Graduate Research Plan Statement. Reach out to potential advisers (if you're an undergraduate student), or meet with your current research adviser (if you're a graduate student) to discuss potential topics for your proposal.<br/><br/><strong>Au</strong><strong>gust</strong>: Outline &amp; draft Graduate Research Plan Statement, contact recommendation letter writers and set up a brief meeting with each<br/><br/><strong>September</strong>:&nbsp;Outline &amp; draft Personal, Relevant Background, &amp; Future Goals Statement, send to reference letter writers for review/editing<br/><br/><strong>October</strong>: Revise/edit statements to fit within page limits, check in with reference letter writers<br/><br/><strong>End of October</strong>: Submit a day early!<br/><br/><em>Wait for what will seem like FOREVER............</em><br/><br/><strong>Late March/Early April:</strong>&nbsp;Hear back from NSF!<br/><br/><strong>May 1st</strong>: Decide!</div>

<div class="wsite-spacer" style="height:50px;"></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u><font size="6">My Advice</font></u></strong><br/><br/><strong>1. R</strong><strong>ead the ENTIRE&nbsp;</strong><strong>solicitation</strong><strong>.</strong><br/>This one may seem obvious, but I think every applicant has good intentions when they start reading it, and then they realize how long it is. It's a list of instructions, and the language is pretty dry, so it's easy to lose focus and start thinking about all the great stuff you're going to write, but the solicitation tells you&nbsp;<strong><em>exactly&nbsp;</em></strong>what you need to do in order to win. Read it carefully, and then reread it.<br/><br/><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Research what has worked for others in the past</strong><strong>.</strong><br/>There are a bunch of great resources out there, so go ahead and use them! More and more often, successful applicants are posting their proposals online, sometimes along with reviewer comments.&nbsp;It's helpful to see what others have done, and you'll have a better idea of what the reviewers are looking for. You can also join the conversation now, on Twitter (@NSFGRFP), on LinkedIn,&nbsp;or at&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.thegradcafe.com/topic/110826-nsf-grfp-2018-2019/?tab=comments#comment-1058620220" target="_blank">thegradcafe&nbsp;</a>forum.<br/><br/><strong>3.&nbsp;Pick your field of study&nbsp;<u>before</u>&nbsp;you start writing.</strong><br/><br/><span>Don't make this decision lightly! There are a lot of options for which field of study your proposed research may fall under (a list can be found at the end of the solicitation). There is also an interdisciplinary option (where you can pick more than one field), and an 'other' option where you fill in your own. These&nbsp;</span><strong>alternative options can be risky</strong><span>&nbsp;in my opinion though. The NSF uses your choice to inform their decision on who your review panel will be (which consists of 3 reviewers usually). If you choose the interdisciplinary or other option, you are probably going to get 1 or 2 reviewers from one field, and 1 or 2 from another field. Not 3 that are fluent in your interdisciplinary or specialized field. So, one or more of your reviewers may not have a knowledge base for the state of the field, or know what the standard practices are to be able to effectively evaluate the originality of your proposed research.&nbsp;</span><strong>You want them to find you impressive.&nbsp;</strong><span>In order to do that, they need to easily understand and identify with every word in your application. Also, choosing multiple or alternative fields makes it harder for you (see #6).</span><br/>&#8203;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/><strong>4.&nbsp;Find a knowledge gap.</strong><br/><span>Even though the GRFP program is constantly reminding applicants that they "fund people, not projects", I think reviewers have a hard time&nbsp;</span><em><strong>not&nbsp;</strong></em><span>making a judgement about whether they think the research is relevant/novel or not. Even if you don't know what it is<em> exactly</em> that you want to research in graduate school, pick a general field, and&nbsp;</span><strong>start reading about what's been done</strong><span>.</span><br/><br/><span>&#8203;There are two ways you can get started:</span><br/><br/><span>1) Pick a school&nbsp;</span>you're interested in<span>, choose an adviser you could see yourself working with, read their publications.</span><br/><br/><span>I went with&nbsp;</span><strong>option 1</strong><span>&nbsp;the first year, because I was an&nbsp;</span><strong>undergraduate</strong><span>&nbsp;and wasn't totally sure what I wanted to research yet. I knew that I wanted to combine chemistry and the environment, so I started searching&nbsp;</span><a href="https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?PathInfo=%2F&amp;Alias=WOK5&amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;Src=IP&amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;Error=IPError" target="_blank">Web of Science</a><span>&nbsp;(check with your university library for how to log in) and came to atmospheric chemistry. I started reading the articles and writing down the authors' names. I looked up where they were located (university, government lab, etc.) and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240225224034/http://www.malloryladd.com/blog/36-questions-to-ask-before-choosing-a-graduate-program" target="_blank">decided if that was a school/program I might want to attend</a><span>. If all those things matched up, I&nbsp;</span><strong>emailed each of them and asked to set up a phone call</strong><span>&nbsp;to discuss their future research directions. Here's a&nbsp;</span><a href="../../../20240117135333/http_/www.malloryladd.com/uploads/2/3/6/0/23606636/2013_doctoral_applicant_email.pdf" target="_blank">sample email</a><span>&nbsp;you could send to break the ice.</span><br/><br/><u><em><strong>OR</strong></em></u><br/><br/><span>2) Pick a general area of research you're interested in, and hit the literature.</span><br/><br/><span>If you are&nbsp;</span><strong>already in graduate school</strong><span>, you might want to go with&nbsp;</span><strong>option 2</strong><span>. Start with review articles, and look in the Discussion or Conclusions for 'future research directions' or 'knowledge gaps'. Take note of the authors that keep popping up, and take a look at what else they've done to get an idea of where the field is heading. Talk to your adviser and other researchers in your department/field too. Sometimes, the state of the field is well beyond what has recently been published, so it helps to talk to people and visit their websites (if they keep them updated).</span><br/><br/><strong>5. Start with an outline.</strong><br/><br/>After you've read the literature, taken some notes on your ideas for a project, and chosen a field of study, make an outline for what your&nbsp;<strong>2-page proposal&nbsp;</strong>is going to look like. I would definitely&nbsp;<strong>start with a broad, impactful statement</strong>&nbsp;that relates to everyone who may read it (see examples essays). Then, throughout your introduction or background paragraph, start to&nbsp;<strong>narrow in&nbsp;</strong>(rather quickly) to your specific area of research and&nbsp;<strong>how it relates to that first statement.</strong>&nbsp;In this first paragraph, you should&nbsp;<strong>point out the knowledge gap</strong>&nbsp;you found too, so then you can transition into your specific research aims and hypotheses. Describe in detail your experimental design and how that will answer your science questions, and make sure to have both an&nbsp;<strong>intellectual merit and broader impacts</strong>&nbsp;section. See #9 for what the solicitation has to say about those.<br/><br/>Here are some hints I picked up from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Science-Papers-Proposals-Funded/dp/0199760241" target="_blank">Writing Science</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://schimelwritingscience.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Josh Schimel</a>:<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Use the ABDCE structure: Action first, then Background, Development, Climax, and finish up with a strong Ending<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Remember the SUCCES model: keep it Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, and tell a Story<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Goals: Create curiosity, define WHY knowledge gap is important, focus on science&nbsp;<em>questions</em>&nbsp;(not objectives)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Endings are power positions; end of sentence, end of paragraph, end of proposal; make them count<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.

For example, when you think about a chemist, what comes to mind? How about when you think of an engineer? A physicist, a psychologist, or a biologist? The list goes on and on, but each one has a history, and a culture that has developed over the years. I think it's helpful to keep this in mind when you're writing, and when you choose the </span><strong>most appropriate panel</strong><span> for your proposed research. You could be a physicist applying to an chemistry panel, or a geographer applying to an engineering panel. Just like knowing your audience before a presentation helps you&nbsp;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240117135348/http://malloryladd.weebly.com/blog/scientific-presentations-powerpoint-dos-and-donts" target="_blank">tailor your slides</a><span>, think about </span><em><strong>who</strong></em><span> you are writing for before you even start writing.</span><br/><br/><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3"><span><span><span><u><span>How the panel works</span></u><span>: </span></span></span></span></font><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3">The NSF will receive your application, run a compliance check that looks for completeness (missing reference letters, etc), separate it based on what year you are (undergraduate, first year graduate student, nontraditional student, etc.) and then send it on to 3 reviewers in the field of study you selected. Each reviewer gets about <strong>30 applications </strong>to read individually. Then, they meet with the other 2 reviewers (oftentimes in a virtual meeting) and decide together who the top candidates are that they want to recommend for funding. You want to make sure your proposal ends up in the <strong>'fund'</strong> pile. Some things that could land you in the <strong>'reject' </strong>pile are:<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Not following directions: exceeding page limits, not addressing intellectual merit and broader impacts, etc.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Making it hard to read: large blocks of text with no headings, not writing FOR your reviewer<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Repeating yourself: you want your essays to be connected but separate; use every sentence to tell the reviewer &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; something new about your potential to succeed<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Writing style and content: don't be negative, dishonest, or use slang/abbreviations that aren't well known; check<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your spelling and grammar too (a few mishaps are okay - see examples below - but do your best to proofread)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Plagiarism: make sure what you write is your own, you'll have to sign a certification to it before you submit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Vague statements: don't say you want to help humanity unless you can say specifically how, and don't say your<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; research is going to develop new methods, instruments, or data unless you say what <em>kind</em> (I made the latter<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mistake&nbsp;the first time around)<br/><br/><strong>7. Keep it clear, concrete, and concise.</strong><br/><br/>Find your own voice and writing style. Stay away from jargon, prepositional phrases, and the long French or Latin versions of words when, in conversation, we normally use the short, Anglo-Saxon version instead (utilize vs use, initiate vs start, attempt vs try, methodology vs method, etc). They take up space, and it definitely doesn't make it any easier for your reviewer to read. Thanks again to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Science-Papers-Proposals-Funded/dp/0199760241" target="_blank">Writing Science</a> for those hints! Finally, <strong>the reviewer should be able to skim over your proposal and quickly be able to answer the following questions:</strong><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. What is/are the science question(s)?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. What are the objectives of the proposal?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. What are the hypotheses?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. How is the applicant testing those hypotheses?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Does this applicant/proposal have the potential to advance our scientific knowledge?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. How will this applicant/proposal benefit society?<br/><br/><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Choose your reference letter writers carefully.</strong><br/><br/>This should be one of the first things you do, but take your time in deciding. Generally, whoever you think is going to be overseeing/advising your research plan, she or he should be one of your letter writers. The other two could be a mentor, a professor you had in class, a previous supervisor, or research adviser for example. They should <strong>know you well</strong>, and be able to comment on specific encounters they have had with you (see reference letter section). Once you have decided on who you will ask, email them early, and attach a description of the fellowship, and review criteria. Don't be afraid to&nbsp;<strong>tell them what you would like them to write about</strong>. This will ensure that your references are all writing about a different positive aspect about you, and your reviewers get a new piece of information with each letter. Send them your CV/resume and tell them what you have been up to lately. Schedule a lunch meeting and stay in touch throughout the application process.<br/><br/>Note: You can select up to 5 letter writers. Only 3 will be submitted to the review panel, and you get to choose which 3 those are in the Fastlane system. It's good to have 2 extras in case the others forget or get too busy, and end up not turning in their letters on time. Also, you might feel like you're nagging, but <strong>they usually appreciate a reminder</strong> email or two so they're not hurrying to write your letter the day before it's due.<br/><br/><strong>9. Explicitly highlight intellectual merit and broader impacts.</strong><br/><br/>These are the only 2 criteria the reviewers have to comment on (see reviewer feedback in Examples section below), so you want to make sure they stand out. Here's the description from the solicitation this year:</font></div>

<blockquote style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3">"The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and the Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes. The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</font><br/><br/><span><span><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3">1. What is the potential for the proposed activity to: </font><br/><span><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields; and<br/><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. Benefit society or advance desired society outcomes?<br/><span>2. To what extent do the proposed activities suggest &amp; explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?<br/><span>3. Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?<br/><span>4. How well-qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?<br/><span>5. Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?<br/><br/><span><span>The NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of <strong>societally relevant</strong> outcomes. <strong>Such outcomes include, but are not limited to</strong>: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the US; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education."</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></font></span></span></span></blockquote>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><br/><font color="#2a2a2a" size="3"><strong>10. Plan to be done a day early.</strong><br/><br/><span><span><span>If you've done it right, one extra day is not enough time to really add anything substantial to your application. You'll feel more relaxed if you're ready to submit a day early. Also, the <strong>system converts your word docs</strong> (or PDFs for that matter) into their own PDF format. The second time around, I submitted on the last day, and when the system converted my PDF application to their format, it pushed my personal statement onto the next page! I had to drop FOUR lines. I totally lost my cool. It wasn't a good feeling and it stressed me out. If you finish a day early though, you'll have plenty of time to rework that essay and make sure you submit without stress. :) Just be sure that when you submit, it is completely finished because once you submit, that's it! No changes.</span></span></span></font></div>
