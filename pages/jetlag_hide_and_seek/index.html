<h2>Jetlag: The Game <i>Hide and Seek</i> narrative tension analysis</h2>

When you are a fan of something like <i>Jetlag: The Game</i>, a natural question to ask yourself is whether the show is actually entertaining. After all, it would be a terrible situation to be entertained by something, and not have a comprehensive, data-driven analysis to validate those feelings. To address this concern, for the four <i>Hide and Seek</i> seasons of <i>Jetlag: The Game</i> (as of February 2026), I went ahead and checked this. <br><br>

Each plot corresponds to a season. Each dot corresponds to a different run, colored by the identity of the hider(s). The y-axis displays the final hider time of that run (including time bonuses). The x-axis displays the hider time <i>X</i> minutes into the episode, where the animation in the GIF steps through values of <i>X</i>. The side panels track Kendall's 𝜏 and the corresponding p-value (excluding NYC, which only has two runs).<br><br>

For a given season, high 𝜏 and low p-value <i>X</i> minutes into the episodes indicates that the hider's time <i>X</i> minutes into the episode has substantial (rank) correlation with the hider's final time. For example, if there was already high 𝜏 and low p-value 10 minutes in, this would mean that 10 minutes into an episode, one would already be able to predict whether it is a winning run. <br><br>

Fortunately the below visualizations show this is not the case. There is no clear relationship between hider time <i>X</i> minutes into the episode and the hider's final time until quite late into the episode.<br><br>

In conclusion, the show is entertaining.
